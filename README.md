Fahrtendienst Dispo Software

Fahrtendienst Application is a complete solution for connecting customers with taxis. The application is developed for both users and drivers, with separate logins for each. Users can request a ride from the nearest driver, and drivers can make their cars available and accept requests.

Using GPS, the app displays all available taxi drivers on the map, and finds the nearest driver to the user’s location, though users can pick a driver themselves. When a user requests a ride, the driver receives a notification when containing the user’s name, contact number, pickup location and drop-off location.
